Wherein I tackle my first improv writing task. Select a topic at random and write for 5m starting each sentence with, "Yes, let's!"<!--more-->

> Yes, let's travel to the Quicksand Dunes, the legendary deathtrap that lies in wait for unwary travellers!
> 
> Yes, let's thumb our noses at the fates and sail our boards down the steep slopes!
> 
> Yes, let's toil our way back up again and again, never falling prey to the slipping, sliding escalators of sand!
> 
> Yes, let's celebrate life at dune's top, thighs shaking from the effort of the climb!
> 
> Yes, let's shout out loud from the highest point: We have conquered this demon!
> 
> Yes, let's dine on our carefully carried basket of culinary treasures, savouring the moments with each bite in the setting sun!
> 
> Yes, let's end our days in the sand and sun heavy with tiredness and dust, carried away by the wind to sleep!
